# HBC Employee &amp; Retiree Committee (HERC)

## We are a committee of 17 former and current employees and retirees of the Hudson's Bay Company ("Hudson's Bay").

We formed our committee to help protect employees and retirees because of HBC's insolvency filing in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on March 7, 2025 and the significant losses to employees and retirees by HBC. HBC is currently liquidating and closing all its stores, and has put all its assets up for sale.

> [!NOTE]
> We have no affiliation with Hudson's Bay and are entirely independent of Hudson's Bay.
